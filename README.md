# io-monorepo-template

Monorepo template for a multiplayer browser game.

This is based off of my setup for a project I've been working on recently, so most of the git history is lost because I just copy-pasted it.

## How do I use this?

I don't think I'll be documenting this in the near future, I only plan on using it to bootstrap my future personal projects faster. The code should be easy to understand, just browse through it.

I recommend using the Docker Compose setup for local dev (`yarn dev:docker`). Make sure you have the new Docker Compose module installed so you can use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`.
